# COS-FFT

This repository contains jupyter notebooks which implement the main functionalities of the option pricing method developed by [Fang & Oosterlee, 2008](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9319/).

The main file is:
[cos_fft_pricing.ipynb](https://github.com/CorinneKnoe/ANMADA/blob/master/COS-FFT/cos_fft_pricing.ipynb) 

which replicates the functions and results described in the paper. 

To calculate and plot the densities, it imports and uses the functions from:
[cos_fft_densities.ipynb](https://github.com/CorinneKnoe/ANMADA/blob/master/COS-FFT/cos_fft_densities.ipynb).
