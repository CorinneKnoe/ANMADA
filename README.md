# Advanced Numerical Methods and Data Analysis
This repository contains projects for the course offered in Spring 2018 at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). The two contributors are [Corinne](https://github.com/CorinneKnoe) and [Simon](https://github.com/Sommer1872).

## [COS-FFT](https://github.com/CorinneKnoe/ANMADA/tree/master/COS-FFT)
Implements the fast option pricing method developed by [Fang & Oosterlee, 2008](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9319/).

## [server-project](https://github.com/CorinneKnoe/ANMADA/tree/master/server-project)
Describes the set up of a personal data server from scratch (using [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)) and documents how we used [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) to pull millions of futures data points to an SQL database on the server with only a few lines of python code.
